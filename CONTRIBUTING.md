# Blacksky Algorithms' Contributor Guide

---
First, we appreciate you showing interest in contributing to the rsky project!

Second, understand that all repositories in the **rsky** repository fall under two categories,
"crates", and "services". Crates are libraries for hosted on the [Crates website](https://crates.io/search?q=rsky).
The repositories in the "services" section are what is being used to serve the end user. 

Lastly, this project heavily involves the AT Protocol. There are resources attached to this
document that you can use to gain a better understanding. 

At a high level, the **Authenticated Transfer Protocol** (aka AT Protocol, ATProto, atproto) is a generic, federated protocol for
building open social media appliactions. **Personal Data Stores** (or PDSs) store user data
and handles identity. **Relays** aggregate and distributes data across the network. **App Views** aggregate data from
the relays, for it to be used in feeds.
